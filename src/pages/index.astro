        Hey there! I&apos;m Damilola – a software developer and sophomore
        software engineering student, a sucker for software that
        _just&nbsp;works_ and is beautifully simple. I constantly build and
        break things (a lot), always learning and expanding my skills so I can
        create seamless, high-performing software that feels intuitive and
        reliable – the kind of software I believe people should experience and
        that I&apos;d love to use.
