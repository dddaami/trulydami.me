      I never liked reading and even often struggled with it. A friend helped me
      see how important reading is. Ever since, books have become some of my
      greatest teachers. They shape the way I think, work, and want to live.
      Through these notes, I’m sharing the key insights and knowledge I’ve
      gained learning from these absolutely brilliant minds.
