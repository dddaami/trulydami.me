      I primarily use PHP, TypeScript, Go, and Python for most of my projects.
      Sometimes I dabble in other tools and languages — out of curiosity,
      necessity, interest, or the occasional paycheck :) <br />
      Below are some of the tools I feel comfortable with, along with general experience
      and some things I really want to try.
